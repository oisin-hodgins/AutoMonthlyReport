\title{Creates agent_kpi_analysis tibble, which stores the agent performance data.}
\usage{
agent_performance_analysis(data = agent_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The dataset containing relevant agent data. Default = agent_data.}
}
\description{
The agent_kpi_analysis tibble ranks all agents from \link{0,1} on a number of metrics,
and also combines these metrics into one overall predictor of performance. This
is a multiple criteria decision analysis problem we are solving, and the method used
is goal programming.
}
\details{
Stores relevant data in agent_kpi tibble, before standardising and normalizing
it in the agent_kpi_analysis tibble. The columns here are explicitly coded, with
the decision of min, max or mean standardisation already addressed. The means
of blue,green and purple clicks are calculated from successful guided conversations only.
Note: process_guided_data() must be run before this function.
