\title{Generates the guided_data tibble used for Guided Conversation analysis}
\usage{
process_guided_data(data = core_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The data set containing the call data. Default = core_data.}
}
\description{
Filters all 'Sale', 'Referral' and 'Other' calls out of the core_data tibble,
also adding five new columns to store the percentage of coloured clicks made
in each guided conversation, and to store the result of a guided conversation.
The eval_guided() function is called here to determine that outcome.
}
\details{
Iterates over core_data filtering out irrelevant calls.
The new "gc\%Blues", "gc\%Reds", "gc\%Greens" and "gc\%Purples" should remain consistent
if the guided conversation architecture changes throughout the period, as it is calculated
from the 'total' value in each call log.
