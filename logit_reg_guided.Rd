\title{Performs multivariate logistic regression on guided_data}
\usage{
logit_reg_guided(data = guided_data)
}

\description{
Adds guided_logit and guided_logit_stat_signif to the global environment.

\details{
Multivariate logistic regression. Success is a binary response variable, while
duration, gc\%Blues, gc\%Reds, gc\%Greens and gc\%Purples are all predictor variables.
Regression is performed using glm() function(from stats).
A Wald-test is performed on each predictor using the wald.test() function from
the "aod" package, and the p-values are recorded in the guideded_logit_stat_signif
tibble, along with a TRUE/FALSE depending on the 0.05 significance threshold.
The goodness of fit of the model is tested through a likelihood ratio test,
and a series of text outputs describe the result.
