\title{Performs Chi-Square test for independence between agent Username and success of a Guided Conversation.}
\usage{
agent_guided_success_Chi_Square_test(data = agent_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The dataset containing relevant agent data. Default = agent_data.}
}
\description{
A frequency of at least 5 for every outcome, that is 5 successes and failures
