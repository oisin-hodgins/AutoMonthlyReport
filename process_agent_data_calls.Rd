\title{Generates agent_data tibble.}
\usage{
process_agent_data_calls(data = core_data, min_calls = 10, at_least_one = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The data set containing the call data. Default = core_data.}

\item{min_calls}{The minimum number of calls required for an agent's data to be stored. Default = 10.}

\item{at_least_one}{If true an agent needs at least one call of each outcome for their data to be stored. Default = TRUE.}
}
\description{
Generates agent_data tibble with following columns:
"username", "total_calls", "total_sales", "total_referrals", "total_guided",
"sale_percent", "ref_percent", "guided_percent", "total_guided_success",
"guided_success_percent".
}
\details{
This function uses the dplyr package to sort through the core_data tibble for data
relating to calls, then uses the same package to join the data together.
The resulting agent_data tibble will be expanded further by the "process_agent_data_duration"
and the "process_agent_data_colours" functions. This tibble is used in the agent performance
analysis.
This is a specific function used for generation of monthly report.
